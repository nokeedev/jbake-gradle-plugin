= JBake plugin for Gradle

This plugin allows rendering a site using https://www.jbake.org[JBake] directly from https://www.gradle.org[Gradle].
It's spiritually connected to https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake-gradle-plugin[the official Gradle plugin] but differ in the following ways:

- The JBake extension can depend on remote content, templates, assets and properties.
- The plugin provide a `jbake` software component for publishing in Maven and Ivy.
  Note that each JBake artifacts are published individually, e.g. content, templates, assets, properties and baked site.
- The project allow creation of additional JBake extension to render other independent type of documentation.

This plugin uses similar defaults as the official plugin.

NOTE: This plugin was develop to support Nokee's development need and is only used as a local plugin.
There is currently no intention of publishing the plugin to the Gradle Plugin Portal.
